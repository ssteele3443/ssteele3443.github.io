     <title>Washington</title>
     
     <p>I liked how on Washington's website it was very organized. The colors were a nie contrast and the buttons were easy to see with the colors that were chosen.</p>
     
     <p>I thought it was interesting how much information Oregon's website had on the main page. It also had dropdowns from the buttons so you were able to easily find what you were looking for. The search bar was front and center which is always important to know where it is</p>
     
     <p>Montana's Website was very similar to Oregon's. There were a lot of pictures showing off the state's beauty. It also has links to its social medias which is always helpful.</p>
