        <p>Ridley is a year and half old dalmatian that love to play and interact. She still has a ton of puppy energy, but she also loves to cuddle with you! She is has one brown eye and one blue eye. The dalmatian breed is known for genetic hindrances such as deafness and high uric acid. If a dog has high uric acid then they are limited to the kinds of food they have because their bodies do not process food normally. Ridley is deaf in one ear so sometimes her hearing perception is a little off. She is still able to hear really well and is a great guard dog. </p>
